# Gitlet
Gitlet is a simplified rendition of the version control system Git using SHA-1 hash codes to mimic Git internal storage mechanisms. 
Functionality includes adding and committing files, getting the current log and status of files, merging, checking out, branching, resetting, finding, and removal of files. Tested using JUnit and integration tests.
